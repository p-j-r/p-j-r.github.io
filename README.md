Currently houses my resume. Earlier home to *codex inexplicabilis*!

The resume format and theme is available under a open-source license from [sproogen](https://github.com/sproogen/jameswgrant) and the asscoiated repo. Due to the changed jekyll theme, codex inexplicabilis has broken and needs to be fixed.

Finally a use!

So we take a topic (any topic), I'll begin probably with physics, and add free (and open-source?) resources related to that topic. The resources are to be of high-quality, preferably something you'll recommend to friends! Also it's preferred to have **short, to-the-point resources**.

This should be an (exhaustive) list for a **newbie** to start exploring that topic.


[TED lectures](https://www.ted.com/) are often very timed and intented for a general audience. 
[Medium](https://medium.com/) articles, [wikipedia pages](https://wikipedia.org), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) preprints etc...
